//! The page daemon: `uvm/uvm_pdaemon.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_pdaemon.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 only needs a `uvm_wait` the allocator can name; it reports the
//! gap, because there is no daemon to wait for before kernel threads exist (M5). The daemon
//! itself (`uvm_pageout`, `uvmpd_scan`, the aiodone daemon) arrives with swapping (M7).

use crate::unported;

/// `uvm_wait`: wait for the page daemon to free memory; nothing can be waited for yet.
pub fn uvm_wait(_wmsg: &str) {
    let _ = unported!("uvm_wait (uvm_pdaemon.c, M5)");
