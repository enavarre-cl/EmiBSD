//! amd64 machine-dependent setup and shutdown: `arch/amd64/amd64/machdep.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/machdep.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M2 ports what the console and a panic need: the first part of
//! `init_x86_64` (message buffer, console, `boot -d`), `boot`, `delay` and the globals they
//! use (`cpureset_delay`, `lid_action`, `waittime`). `cpu_startup`, the descriptor tables,
//! `cpu_reset`, `dumpsys`, the bootinfo parsing, `sendsig`/`setregs` and the sysctl tree arrive
//! with M3 to M5.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Limine has set up long mode, paging and the direct map before `init_x86_64` runs, so the
//!   memory-map and page-table work of the C version is replaced by the boot protocol
//!   (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, "Boot flow"); `pmap_bootstrap` arrives with M3.
//! - The message buffer is a static area (`kern/subr_log.rs`, `init_static_msgbuf`) instead of
//!   reserved physical pages, until M3.
//! - `cninit()` is replaced by `consinit()` (`consinit.rs`): no `constab[]` yet.
//! - `delay` is `i8254_delay` directly; `delay_func`, `delay_init` and `delay_fini` (the TSC
//!   upgrade) arrive with M5.
//! - `boot`: under feature `qemu`, the wait for a key after "The operating system has halted"
//!   is the emulator exit with the failure status, which `xtask smoke` checks after a panic.
//!   `vfs_shutdown`, `resettodr`, `if_downall`, `uvm_shutdown`, `dumpsys`,
//!   `config_suspend_all`, ACPI and `cpu_reset` are reported as unported when reached.
